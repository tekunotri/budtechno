## Installation and Customization
The [HUD wiki](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/wiki) contains a wealth of information on installing the HUD as well as customizing it. Feel free to reach out in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) if you have further questions, though!

## budhud Updater Script
budhud includes a shell script (`budhud Updater.ps1`) in the base directory that will allow you to do a few different things:
- Verify that your HUD installation is correct
- Download/update the default HUD files
- Download/install a fresh version of the HUD from GitHub
- Set your HUD language
- Compile the HUD's #base lines (which improves performances in certain scenarios)

To open this file, you need to Right click the file and select `Run with PowerShell`.
