# Contributing to budhud
Please note that contributions or pull requests (PRs) to budhud should be reserved for fixing bugs/issues with the display of the HUD. This can include things like overlapping elements, incorrect colors, broken animations, and so on. Including screenshots of your changes is a major plus, as well!

Contributions aimed at adding new features or reworking parts of the HUD are not encouraged through PRs. While I appreciate suggestions for additions/changes/etc, I prefer these to be posted in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) or in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/issues) so that I can decide if and how to implement them. HUDs are inherently subjective and personal for most developers, and it would be unfortunate for someone to do a lot of work only to have their PR rejected. This is also why I'd encourage people to fork the HUD instead.

## Formatting
If you do make a PR, please make sure you're following the same format budhud uses:
- For indenting, use **spaces** instead of **tabs**
- Indent values to column 69

## Questions
For any questions, please feel free to message me in the [Discord](https://discord.gg/PTWkt3h) or drop an issue in the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/rbjaxter/budhud/issues).
